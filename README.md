# Replica of CNM06: COGS 118A Project

### Introduction
In 2006, Caruana & Niculescu-Mizil wrote a paper evaluating various supervised learning methods and their performance on multiple datasets. I created a mini-scale replica where I ran 3 algorithms on 4 datasets gathered from UCI's Machine Learning Depository, and I utilized 3 metrics to evaluate the performance of these algorithms. 

### Libraries Used:
* numpy
* pandas
* sklearn
* seaborn
* matplotlib

### Algorithms:
* Support Vector Machiens
* Decision Trees
* Logistic Regression

### Metrics:
* Accuracy
* Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) Area Under Curve (AUC)
* F1 Score

### Datasets:
* ADULT - measuring income of adults in America based on certain standards
* LETTER - predicting what written letter is based on certain characteristics
* CHESS - deciding optimal depth of win based on the play moves of the players
* OCCUPANCY - deciding if chemical is occupant within a room based on certain properties and features of the room
