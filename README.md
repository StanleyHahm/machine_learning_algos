# Replica of CNM06: COGS 118A Project

### Introduction
In 2006, Caruana & Niculescu-Mizil wrote a paper evaluating various supervised learning methods and their performance on multiple datasets. I created a mini-scale replica where I ran 3 algorithms on 4 datasets gathered from UCI's Machine Learning Depository, and I utilized 3 metrics to evaluate the performance of these algorithms.
